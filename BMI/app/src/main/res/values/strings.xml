    <string name="extremely_obese_info_info">
        A BMI of over 35 indicates that you are heavily overweight.\n\nDoctors use BMI to define severe obesity rather than
        a certain number of pounds or a set weight limit, because BMI factors weight in relation to height.\n\nYour health
        is at risk. In every moment you can get a heart attack or a stroke.\n\nExcessive body weight is associated with
        various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive
        sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis, and asthma. As a result, obesity has been found to reduce
        life expectancy.\n\nYou are strictly recommended to talk to your doctor or a dietitian for advice.
